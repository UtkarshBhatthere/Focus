# Focus: A clean To-Do App/Widget.
==================================

Focus is a opensource application built using electron framework to provide a concise to-do task widget that one can use to steer away from the distractions. It shows the current task you have to do, the overall progress w.r.t. the tasks list provided and also shows the number of seconds you are taking to complete the task (maybe i'll change that to minutes). Try it up, get Focus!
